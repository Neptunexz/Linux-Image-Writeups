# Removed unauthorized system account
  - For this vulnerability, there are three routes of finding unauthorized users. UI, /home directory, and the /etc/passwd file all show the accounts on the system to varrying degrees. For this one, you need to check out /etc/passwd.

  - Once you locate the user account, you can use the sudo deluser <username> command to rmeove them.

    <summary>Answer:</summary>
<p> network </p>
</details>

# System account does not have a password set
  - For this vulnerability, you can check out /etc/shadow and check out the accounts with passwords. If the account does not belong to a user account AND has a password set, delete the password from the line in the file.

<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>
<p> bin </p>
</details>

# System account has a nologin or false shell
  - For this vulnerablity, you can check out /etc/passwd, where the shell environments are set for all accounts. All system accounts need to have a /bin/false or a /usr/sbin/nologin shell set, instead of /bin/bash.

# A secure maximum password age has been set
  - This is standard practice. Just change it to 30-90 days in /etc/login.defs.

# Password encryption method set to SHA512
  - This one is a little less common. Also configurable in /etc/login.defs. SHA512 is the best security practice here.

# A secure number of login retries is configured
  - This one is (also) configured in /etc/login.defs. Anything between 1-5 is acceptable.

# Account lockout policy configured
  - If you know what to add to common-auth, go for it, but i prefer to do it this way.
